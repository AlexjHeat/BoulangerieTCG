~~~Battle Algorithm~~~
3 cards, must be all from same house

Players may select between 3 actions (triangle dis/advantage): React > Post > Lurk
Whichever is selected, all the point totals of that active card will be added.

Dis/Advantage ideas:
-Points will be multiplied by 1.5x
-Player w advantage rolls twice + takes higher and/or player w disadvantage rolls twice + takes lower
-Player w advantage takes the higher die roll of the two

Rolling/Random mechanic ideas:
*Total points would range from 5 - 60
*There should always be a chance of either side winning, no matter how minuscule (maybe)
*Duels should be equally random, or at least less random, as duelists become higher levels
-roll dX where X is (p1 total + p2 total)
    *when values are very far apart, chance is very slanted, but always possible
    *randomness stays the same as level becomes higher

    TODO: Figure out how~!
        - No images, just scrollable text stats in chat
        - Webapp that has every card, shows level or greyed out if unowned, displays number of shards beneath
        - Most likely do first one short term then work on second

*Private [true/false] : Determines whether deck may be viewed by other players or not.
